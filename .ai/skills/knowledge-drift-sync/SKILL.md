description: Use before finishing any non-trivial change to Ork. Reconciles code with specs/, decisions/, rfcs/, runbook/, the interaction map, memories, and changesets so no knowledge is left stale.

# knowledge-drift-sync

## Prerequisites

- The change under review: `git diff` (working tree) or `git diff main...HEAD`
  (branch).

## Workflow

1. **List what changed** in behavior or structure.
2. **Find each change's canonical home** in the table below and compare:
   - code changed behavior → update the spec in the same change;
   - a spec changed → the code implements it, or the spec says it is not built
     yet (its status line);
   - a lint-enforced rule changed → `oxlint.config.ts` and
     [specs/architecture.md](../../../specs/architecture.md) agree.
3. **Decisions:** an RFC that shipped gets an ADR, status `Implemented`, and
   moves to `rfcs/archived/`; both indexes are updated. A hard-to-reverse choice
   made without an RFC has an ADR.
4. **Interaction map:** a change in how parts interact, or a part becoming built,
   runs the [resync-map](../resync-map/SKILL.md) skill.
5. **Releases:** a change to shipped code carries a changeset; internal-only
   work carries an empty one
   ([runbook/development/release.md](../../../runbook/development/release.md)).
6. **Memories:** update `last-verified` on each memory you re-checked; fix or
   delete stale statements. Resolve working memories tied to this change.
7. **Checks:** `pnpm check` passes, which includes `pnpm docs:check` and
   `pnpm map:check`.
8. **Report** what was synchronized, or state "no drift" with the evidence.

## Constraints

- Follow the precedence order in [`.ai/README.md`](../../README.md); when code
  and a spec disagree and the intent is unclear, ask — do not guess.
- Fix the lower-precedence source or flag it; never silently pick one.

## Useful commands

```sh
git diff --stat main...HEAD
pnpm check
pnpm docs:check
pnpm map:check
```

## Expected output

A drift report plus the doc and code changes, in the same change.
